# Frontend Package (@narrow-ai-matchmaker/frontend)

This package contains the React (Vite + TypeScript) frontend application for the Narrow AI Matchmaker platform.

## Running Locally

1.  **Environment:** Ensure you have a `.env` file in this directory (`application/packages/frontend`) with the necessary environment variables (see `.env.example`). Primarily, `VITE_API_BASE_URL` should point to your running backend API.

    npm install
    ```

3.  **Start Development Server:**
    ```bash

    npm run dev
    ```
    Alternatively, use the "Run Frontend (npm run dev)" launch configuration in VS Code.
