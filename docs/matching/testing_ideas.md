# Testing Ideas: Signal vs. Noise Approach

This document outlines a strategy for testing the effectiveness of the matching algorithm.

## Core Idea

To validate the matching system's ability to find relevant connections amidst irrelevant ones, we can use a "Signal vs. Noise" approach:

1.  **Generate "Noise" Pool:** Create a relatively large set (e.g., 50-100+) of generic user profiles using the data generator script with general prompts. This represents the background population.

2.  **Generate/Create "Signal" Profiles:** Create specific profiles (either manually or using the generator with targeted prompts) designed to represent known good matches based on the scenarios in `example_match_scenarios.md` and `user_archetypes.md`.
    *   Also, manually define the *expected* high-relevance matches between these signal profiles (`expected_signal_matches.json`).

3.  **Combine Data:** For each test run, load the "Noise" pool and one or more "Signal" profiles/pairs into the matching system's data store (e.g., vector database).

4.  **Execute Test Query:** Query the system for matches for one of the "Signal" users.

5.  **Evaluate Results:** Analyze the ranked list of matches returned by the system:
    *   **Recall:** Is the expected "Signal" partner found?
    *   **Precision/Ranking:** How highly ranked is the expected partner compared to the "Noise" profiles?

6.  **Iterate:** Repeat steps 3-5 for different signal pairs/scenarios to systematically test various matching dimensions (complementarity, location, interest, etc.).

## Benefits

*   Provides a more realistic test environment than evaluating pairs in isolation.
*   Allows for quantitative evaluation of recall and ranking performance.
*   Helps verify that different types of desired matches (based on scenarios) can be reliably identified.
