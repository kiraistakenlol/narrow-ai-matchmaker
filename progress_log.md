## Session: 2025-04-17 (Initial Setup & Brainstorming)

**Summary:**
*   Created initial project documentation structure:
    *   Refined `idea.md` with detailed vision, MVP, modules, and initial test case.
    *   Created `README.md` with project summary and links.
    *   Created `technical_overview.md` outlining high-level architecture, module interaction flow (sequence diagram), and refined module roles.
*   Focused brainstorming on the matching component:
    *   Created `matching/` directory.
    *   Documented strategies and challenges for scaling matching (`matching/matching_strategies_and_challenges.md`).
    *   Explored vector database fundamentals (`matching/vector_database_fundamentals.md`).
    *   Compared vector vs. graph databases (`matching/vector_vs_graph_databases.md`).
    *   Documented example matching scenarios (`matching/example_match_scenarios.md`).
    *   Discussed and documented strategies for prioritizing matching criteria.
*   Standardized documentation filenames to lowercase and updated internal links.

**Next Step:**
*   Define and create concrete test data representing structured user profiles (simulating the output of audio processing/entity extraction). This could be a list of JSON objects, each representing a user with extracted fields (skills, location, goals, etc.) based on the example scenarios. The goal is to have tangible data to start experimenting with matching logic/vectorization.
