extract logic for signing or onboarding to 

a separate component that accepts

1. a list of guidelines to talk about:

- your name
- your background
- what is your current goal

2. title "Welcome to narrow Ai matcher"

or for example "Welcome to Alepth Hub"

3. optional success redirect url: /event/{id}

this component is going to be shown to the user when the user is not signed in 

## ITEM 1
this component has to be able to handle the case where the user is signed in but he is not onboarded or/and he's not joined the event (event specific onboarding)
for this, probably, this componnt can be decomposited
