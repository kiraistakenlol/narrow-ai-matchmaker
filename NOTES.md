# Notes, Ideas, and TODOs

This file is a scratchpad for miscellaneous ideas, potential features, and actionable TODO items related to the project.

## Strategy Notes / Focus

*   **Initial Testing Focus:** For the first phase of testing (e.g., conference use case), we should prioritize generating test data based on a core subset of user archetypes relevant to that context. This likely includes: Skill Provider (Seeking Role/Project), Opportunity Provider (Needing Skills/Talent), Event Attendee (Goal-Oriented), Mentor, Mentee, and perhaps General Connector. Focusing on these initially will help validate the system's effectiveness for the primary MVP use case before expanding.
