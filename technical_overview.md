# Technical Overview: Narrow AI Matchmaker

## 1. Goal

This document outlines the high-level technical architecture and design considerations for the Narrow AI Matchmaker platform.

## 2. High-Level Architecture

The system is envisioned as a set of interacting modules:

*   **Profile Storage:** A persistent store for user profile data. This might involve a combination of databases (e.g., relational for structured data, vector DB for embeddings).
*   **Profile Input/Processing:** Handles the ingestion of user data (initially audio, potentially text, etc.), including transcription (Speech-to-Text) and information extraction/structuring (LLMs).
*   **Matching Engine:** Core logic for comparing profiles and identifying potential matches. This module interacts heavily with Profile Storage and likely uses ML/LLM techniques.
*   **Client Interface:** Provides endpoints for profile creation/management, retrieves match suggestions, and facilitates user interaction (e.g., viewing matches, initiating contact). This could be a web app, mobile app interface, or potentially API-driven for integration.
