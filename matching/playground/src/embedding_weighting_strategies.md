# Weighting Specific Information in Embeddings

**Challenge:** Standard embedding models (e.g., OpenAI's) capture overall meaning but lack direct controls to weigh specific text parts (like skills) more heavily than others (like hobbies).

**Goal:** Make criteria like skills more influential in similarity matching.

## Potential Solutions

*(Visual diagrams would best illustrate these flows, but the steps below outline the sequence)*

### 1. Hybrid Search: Vector + Metadata (Recommended)

*   **Concept:** Combine semantic vector search with structured data filtering/ranking.
*   **Ingestion Flow:**
    1.  Input Profile Text -> Extract Skills -> Store Skills in Payload
    2.  Input Profile Text -> OpenAI Embedding -> Store Vector
    3.  Store {Vector, Payload (with Skills)} in Qdrant Point
*   **Search Flow:**
    1.  Query Profile ID -> Qdrant: Retrieve Query Vector
    2.  Query Vector -> Qdrant: Vector Search (with optional Payload Filter for must-have skills) -> Get Top N {Point ID, Vector Score, Payload}
    3.  Results -> Application: Fetch Full Profile Data (if needed)
    4.  Application: Calculate Skill Match Score (using Payloads)
    5.  Application: Combine {Vector Score + Skill Score} -> Final Ranked List
*   **Pros:** Flexible, powerful, common industry standard.
*   **Cons:** Requires data extraction, adds post-search processing step.

### 2. Multiple Vectors per Profile

*   **Concept:** Use separate embeddings for different text aspects.
*   **Ingestion Flow:**
    1.  Input Profile Text -> OpenAI Embedding -> Vector A (Full Text)
    2.  Input Profile Text -> Extract Skills Text -> OpenAI Embedding -> Vector B (Skills)
    3.  Store {Vector A, Vector B, Payload} in Qdrant Point (using named vectors)
*   **Search Flow:**
    1.  Query Profile ID -> Qdrant: Retrieve Query Vector A & Vector B
    2.  Query Vectors -> Qdrant: Multi-Vector Search (against Vector A & Vector B fields) -> Get Top N {Point ID, Combined Score, Payload}
    3.  Results -> Application: Fetch Full Profile Data -> Final Ranked List
*   **Pros:** Isolates semantic meaning of different sections.
*   **Cons:** Higher complexity (Qdrant setup, query logic, scoring), increased embedding costs.

### 3. Input Text Manipulation (Less Reliable)

*   **Concept:** Try to influence the model by modifying the input text.
*   **Ingestion Flow:**
    1.  Input Profile Text -> Modify Text (e.g., repeat skills) -> Modified Text
    2.  Modified Text -> OpenAI Embedding -> Store Vector
    3.  Store {Vector, Payload} in Qdrant Point
*   **Search Flow:** (Standard Vector Search)
    1.  Query Profile ID -> Qdrant: Retrieve Query Vector
    2.  Query Vector -> Qdrant: Vector Search -> Get Top N {Point ID, Vector Score, Payload}
    3.  Results -> Application: Fetch Full Profile Data -> Final Ranked List
*   **Pros:** Simple to try.
*   **Cons:** Unpredictable results, may distort meaning, risk of hitting token limits. **Generally not recommended.**

## Recommendation

**Hybrid Search (Option 1)** offers the best balance of semantic search and specific criteria matching for most applications.
