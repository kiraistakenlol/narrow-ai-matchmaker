# Vector Database Exploration

This directory contains experiments and notes related to exploring the use of vector databases for the Narrow AI Matchmaker project.

## Goal

The primary goal is to evaluate different vector database technologies and techniques for:

*   Storing vector embeddings generated from user profiles (text, potentially audio).
*   Performing efficient similarity searches to find potential matches based on user goals, skills, and interests.
*   Understanding the trade-offs between different databases and indexing strategies.

## Contents

This directory may include:
*   Proof-of-concept code snippets for interacting with various vector databases.
*   Notes on setup, configuration, and performance.
*   Sample data and embedding generation scripts.
*   Comparisons between different approaches.
